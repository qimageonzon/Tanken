      "- **Dexterity:** 14 (+2)\n",

      "- Perception\n",
      "- Survival\n",

      "**Features:**\n",
      "- **Fighting Style:** Choose \"Defense\" for a simple bonus. While wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\n",

      "You find yourself in the bustling town of Greenhaven, a place where adventurers gather to seek fortune and fame. The air is filled with the sounds of merchants calling out their wares and the clatter of hooves on cobblestone streets. As you walk through the town square, a town crier calls for adventurers to aid with a growing problem: strange creatures have been spotted near the old ruins just outside of town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you choose to investigate this mystery, or perhaps explore the town further to gather more information?\n",

      "**Town Crier:** \"Ah, an adventurer! Thank the gods. The townsfolk are growing nervous with each passing day. Strange creatures have been seen near the old ruins to the north.

      "\n",

      "You nod resolutely, accepting the task. The town crier gives you a map with directions to the ruins and wishes you luck. As you leave the town behind, the path winds through a dense forest, the air growing cooler and the shadows longer as you approach the ancient stone structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "After an hour of travel, you arrive at the outskirts of the ruins. The area is eerily quiet, and you can see the crumbling remains of what was once a grand castle. Vines and moss cover the stone, and you notice a faint light flickering within one of the larger structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "What would you like to do? You could:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Approach the ruins cautiously, trying to stay hidden.\n",
      "2. Call out to see if anyone responds.\n",
      "3. Charge boldly into the ruins, ready for combat.\n",
      "4. Inspect the surrounding area for clues or hidden dangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choose your path, Elara Brightwood.\n",

      "3. I charge while screaming \"FOR THE KING\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a battle cry of \"FOR THE KING!\" you charge boldly into the ruins, your longsword raised and ready for combat. The echoes of your voice bounce off the ancient stone walls, and you can almost feel the spirits of old warriors urging you on.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you burst into the central courtyard, you catch sight of several goblins huddled around a small campfire. They jump up in surprise, grabbing their crude weapons. There are four goblins in total, and they look ready to defend their makeshift camp.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Move closer and attack with your longsword.\n",
      "2. Use a ranged weapon if you have one.\n",
      "3. Take a defensive stance to prepare for their attack.\n",
      "4. Use any other action you think might be useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choose your action, Elara Brightwood!\n",
      "\n",
      "2. I take out my bow and use a frost imbued arrow, hoping to freeze Goblin 2\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent choice! You swiftly draw your bow and notch a frost-imbued arrow, aiming at Goblin 2. The magical frost glistens along the arrow's shaft as you draw the string taut.\n",

      "**(Rolling a d20 to hit...)**\n",
      "\n",
      "You rolled a **16**. Adding your proficiency bonus (+2) and Dexterity modifier (+2), your total attack roll is **20**. \n",
      "\n",
      "That's a hit! Now let's roll for damage. A standard bow deals 1d8 damage, and we'll add the frost effect on top of that.\n",

      "**(Rolling for damage...)**\n",
      "\n",
      "You rolled a **6** on the d8. The frost effect deals an additional 1d4 cold damage.\n",

      "**(Rolling for frost damage...)**\n",
      "\n",
      "You rolled a **3** on the d4. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, the total damage is 6 (piercing) + 3 (cold) = **9 damage**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goblin 2 takes the arrow straight to the chest, and the frost spreads across its body, freezing it in place. It lets out a gurgling cry before collapsing to the ground, incapacitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it's Goblin 4's turn. Seeing their comrade fall, Goblin 4 charges at you with a crude scimitar.\n",
      "\n",
      "**(Rolling a d20 for Goblin 4's attack...)**\n",
      "\n",
      "It rolls a **14**. Adding its attack modifier (+4), it totals **18**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your AC is 18 (16 from chain mail + 2 from shield). The goblin's attack just barely hits!\n",
      "\n",
      "**(Rolling for damage...)**\n",
      "\n",
      "Goblin 4 deals **4** damage with its scimitar.\n",
      "\n",
      "You feel a sharp sting as the goblin's blade grazes your arm, but you stand firm, ready for the next round.\n",
